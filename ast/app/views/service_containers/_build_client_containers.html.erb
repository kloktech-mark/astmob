============================
Jan 19, 2010: version 1.0.5
  + Created a new url for downloading a ruby-built json object instead of hand-built json-look-alike html code. 
    It's accessible at http://[AST_SERVER]/service_containers/build_autoformat_client_containers/[HOSTNAME].[FORMAT].
    The object downloaded does not include any comments, and its format is slightly different than the hand-crafted code.
    Currently [FORMAT] can be 'json' or 'xml'.
    The previous url still works as it always has.
July 16, 2009: version 1.0.4
  / Updated json-creating code to reflect a bug fix in how service_checks were incorrectly displayed if the last field was optional
    and left blank. This also appeared if the service_check had several fields without get_opt-type labels.
=====
May 19, 2009: version 1.0.3

 + Empty containers no longer will make it into the json.
 - Removed references to internal/external checker types.
=====
