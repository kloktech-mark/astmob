= Installation =

Ruby on Rails has notion of dev and production environment which one can have different settings for each.  Very useful as it gives a way to play with new thing without breaking production while still having code check in.

Therefore, we will break installation into two sections, one for dev and one for production.  However, it is NOT mandatory to use production method to run in production, it's just a bit more optimized in things like caching.

Some of the initial setup such as DB setup are the same between dev and production.
