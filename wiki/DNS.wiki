AST can be used to generate dns configuration. 

= Step-By-Step Guide =

  # Create zones.
  # Asset will be places under closest match zone.  For example:
    * There are two zone, xyz.com and abc.xyz.com.
    * host1.abc.xyz.com will show up in abc.xyz.com's zone file and *not* in xyz.com.
    * Create a base zone like xyz.com can help catching some misspelled hostnames.
  # Run ast_dns script which reads /etc/bind/named.conf.local and ask AST server for records of each zone.
  # Script is written in Perl and requires BIND::Conf_Parser, debian has it in package, libbind-confparser-perl.
  # Run script with enough privileges to write where zone files are specified in named.conf.local.
